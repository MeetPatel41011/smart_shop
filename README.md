The Indian economy heavily relies on its medium and small scale vendors -or *the MSME Sector*. A dominant class in the market, the importance of this sector is cemented by the recent investments done in it by the Government of India to ease the pandemic stricken class of the largest vendors, merchants and small scale industries and businesses. 

Although a substantial number of operations happen in this class-when it comes to logistics and management at a planned level, it is *almost non-existent* -be it because of lack of resources, or lack of general know-how.

Now some apps *claim* to resolve this issue and bridge the gap of B2B logistics for MSMEs, the heavier consideration in those apps lean towards *payments* and *payment gateways*, where sellers and businesses can keep a consolidated log of incoming and outgoing monetary expenditures, there is little or no functionality for inventory management and monitoring.

***Buho*** introduces the concept of a complete inventory management solution to medium and small scale vendors. With just a few taps away, your entire store logistics, ranging from a comprehensive catalogue management to incoming and outgoing inventory from the warehouse. 
*Buho* uses Machine learning to classify objects into categories categories, so you do not have to manually enter each and every product detail. Just point your camera at the product, and *Buho* will do the job for you. No intricate *mumbo jumbo*.

Moreover, future updates plan to integrate a dynamic budgeting option -giving a vendor power to track their bulk budget, and alerts on a depleting inventory.

Everything is ~~customizable~~ *extremely customizable*, so you need not worry about a wrong entry. Just go into settings, and change whatever you need to.
